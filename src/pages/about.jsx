        Buzz words. Simply put they are not who I am. Yes, they describe my work in 10 words or less, but again, they
        are not who I am. I am a simple person. I like simple things in my life. I am a self-described audiophile with a
        limited budget. I play computer games. I love my pets, four cats and a dog. And I love the woman in my life.

        And perhaps none of this helps you, or maybe it does. Let's speak candidly. One aspect of my life not mentioned
        earlier is that I am a quadriplegic. Without delving into medical details, here's the short version: I have
        limited mobility in my hands and no sensation from the mid-chest down. Now some will say telling you this puts
        me at a disadvantage. Maybe they are right. Only you can answer that question. Does it? There are other
        important parts of me you should know. I am honest to a fault, often to my detriment, and I am a visual thinker.
        I can visualize designs clearly in my mind, even at the concept stage. Due to my disability, I am committed to
        making designs accessible to everyone and ensuring the best possible user experience.

        If you've read this far, that means there is something about me that intrigues you. So let us now talk about me
        as a professional. I graduated Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida in January of 2020 in Simulations
        and Visualizations, a BS degree in virtual reality also known as immersive technologies. Then in January of 2021
        I was hired by Potawatomi Training, LLC (PT) as a Media Developer, placed into a Frontend Developer role where I
        learned HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery on the job. At PT I collaborated with a team building two different
        e-learning websites for US government entities. The first website has a focus on language. The second website is
        on military provisioning. As the second project was entering its final stages I found a position at Advanced
        Automation Corporation (AAC) where I am currently employed. Here at AAC I am once again working on an e-learning
        course for a government entity. This time though, the course is built in ReactJS, again learned on the job.

        As a Developer I love getting a new task where I get to build new user experiences. For instance, two of my most
        favorite pages within the current project are a page representing Flash Cards and a Media Player. In Flash Cards
        we present the learner with options to customize the content to help ease their learning of the material. The
        media player is written with performance and appearance in mind. I kept the design simple yet familiar, while
        adding additional features such as Focus Points and Knowledge Checks. Focus Points are timestamps chosen for
        content that should be noted by the learner. Knowledge Checks are like Focus Points in that they rely on
        timestamps; they differ in that they ask the learner a question regarding the content being presented.
