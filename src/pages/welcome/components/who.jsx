        <p>
          I am an experienced web developer with a passion for learning and creating. My experience as a front-end
          developer has given me the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, from small personal projects such as
          this portfolio to large web applications. I am always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
          Currently I am working at Advanced Automation Corporation (AAC) where we are developing an e-learning platform
          focusing on foreign language. I am excited to continue growing as a developer and to work on new and exciting
          projects.
